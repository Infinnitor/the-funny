play funny sound effect!!


# usage:

sounds are played based on the arguments passed to the program
each character in the arguments represents a sound

the `sfxmap.json` file defines which character is mapped to which sound.
edit it to whatever

appending `-o` / `--out` flag to the arguments will cause the output audio stream to be exported to a file (`out.wav` by default)
